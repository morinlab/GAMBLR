## About

The GAMBLR-verse is a database, mining, manipulation and collection of a convenience functions for working with genomic data of mature B-cell lymphomas. The GAMBLR is an R package that is a wrapper providing a convenient one-stop access to load the following packages from the GAMBLR family:

- [GAMBLR.data](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR.data) - a "storage unit" with [different types](https://morinlab.github.io/GAMBLR.data/resources/bundled_data.html) of bundled data
- [GAMBLR.helpers](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR.helpers) - a set of low-level functions for data operation
- [GAMBLR.utils](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR.utils) - higher level set of functions to operate on genomic data
- [GAMBLR.viz](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR.viz) - set of functions used mostly for visualizations
- [GAMBLR.results](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR.results) - collection of functions to efficiently retreive data generated by LCR-modules within GAMBL project


::: {.callout-tip title="Who should use this package?"}
This package is for the members of Morin Lab and GAMBL consortium with approved access to the restricted access data.

## Install

To install this package, we recommend doing it by accessing the latest master version directly from GitHub (requires `devtools` dependency).

```r
devtools::install_github(
    "morinlab/GAMBLR",
    repos = BiocManager::repositories()
)
```

::: {.callout-note title="Got permission error at this step?" collapse="true"}
This is because both `GAMBLR.results` and `GAMBLR` packages are private and have restricted access. Please contact Kostia or Ryan through Slack to be added to the list of approved users. Be sure your GitHub ID is added to your Slack profile.

## Quickstart

The quick and easy way to get started is to make sure the `devtools` dependency is installed, then install the GAMBLR and run the simplest functions to confirm successful setup:

```r
# Verify devtools is installed
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

# Install GAMBLR
devtools::install_github(
    "morinlab/GAMBLR",
    repos = BiocManager::repositories()
)
```

We recommend restarting your R session after the installation.

```r
library(GAMBLR)

# Confirm successful setup
metadata <- get_gambl_metadata()
maf <- get_coding_ssm()
```

## Installation for developers

The easiest way to obtain and contribute to GAMBLR is to do this via cloning the repository

```bash
cd
git clone git@github.com:morinlab/GAMBLR.git
```
In your R editor of choice (which is __**hopefully**__ [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), set your working directory to the directory you just cloned the repo into.

```bash
setwd("~/GAMBLR")
```

Install the package in R by running the following command (requires the
`devtools` package):

```r
devtools::install()
```

After applying your modifications to the code, use the following command to
quickly test your changes without directly installing the package (requires the
`devtools` dependency):

```r
devtools::load_all()
```

The Master branch of the GAMBLR repo is protected. We welcome contributions (pull request, bug report, feature request, PR review) from all levels of users. All commits must be submitted via pull request on a branch. Please refer to the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for details on how to do pull request, or ask for help in the `#git-help` Slack channel.
