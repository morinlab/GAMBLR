The GAMBLR is an R package that is a wrapper providing a convenient one-stop access to load the following packages from the GAMBLR family:\n\nGAMBLR.data - a “storage unit” with different types of bundled data\nGAMBLR.helpers - a set of low-level functions for data operation\nGAMBLR.utils - higher level set of functions to operate on genomic data\nGAMBLR.viz - set of functions used mostly for visualizations\nGAMBLR.results - collection of functions to efficiently retreive data generated by LCR-modules within GAMBL project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho should use this package?\n\n\n\nThis package is for the members of Morin Lab and GAMBL consortium with approved access to the restricted access data."
